# verbatim-system-status-tracker

**Name:** Verbatim System Status

**Core Design Principles:**

* **Transparency:**  Prioritizes honest and detailed communication.
* **Clarity:** Employs simple language and avoids technical jargon.
* **Real-time Accuracy:**  Provides information as close to the actual event as possible.
* **User-Centrism:**  Focuses on how issues may impact user experience

**Key Visuals and Structure**

* **Banner:**  At the very top, a color-coded banner displays the overall system health:
    * Green: All Systems Operational 
    * Yellow: Minor Disruption  
    * Orange: Partial Service Outage
    * Red: Critical Outage
* **Component Grid:** Below the banner, a grid breaks down vital Verbatim services:
    *  Core Posting 
    *  Messaging
    *  Search
    *  API/Developer Tools
    *  Each has a small status icon (green checkmark, orange yield, red exclamation point)  
* **Incident History:**  A scrollable log with:
    * Timestamp of each incident
    * Short, plain-language issue descriptions
    * Color-coded status (resolved, ongoing, in-review)

**Innovative Features**

* **Personalized Impact:**  
    * A section titled "How this might affect you" next to each disrupted component. 
     * Example: "Core Posting - Limited image uploads until resolution."
* **"Subscribe to Updates" Button:**  Offers options for:
    *  Email
    *  Text-based Alerts
    *  Push notifications (if Verbatim has an app)
* **Estimated Resolution Time (if possible):** 
    *  This is tricky but sets expectations. It could be a range rather than a specific time.
* **Community Forum Link:**  A prominent link connecting users to a discussion forum for sharing experiences, helping each other, and providing support during outages.

**Important Considerations**

* **Simple Language:**  Technical jargon alienates users. Focus on how it affects their usage.
* **Mobile Friendly:**  Many users will access the status page via their phones.
* **Honesty:**  Even if problems are severe, users value honesty over sugarcoating or overly corporate language.
* **Empathy:** Acknowledge the frustration outages cause â€“ even a simple "We know this is inconvenient..." goes a long way. 

**Extra Design Flair**

* Verbatim can subtly match its brand colors to the status banner and icons.  
* Consider gentle animation to draw the eye to an updated component without being distracting.
